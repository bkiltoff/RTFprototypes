RTF "macro" (Excel) for Sno-Isle staff

Open the 'Macro File' folder and download the latest Excel file. Any time you need to reset your file (e.g., if you accidentally delete it), you can return to this website to download it again.

Instructions
=============
Setup:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Review the Ranked Sections table:</li>
    <ol>
    <li>Rearrange the sections as necessary.</li>
    <li>Add or delete sections as needed.</li>
    </ol>
<li>Review the Index table:</li>
<ol>
<li>Change any Section assignments as necessary (in the last column)</li>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
Running the program:
<ol>
<li>Run the RTF Report out of Polaris as usual, and be sure that the Excel file is still open. </li>
<li>In the Excel program, click "Sort RTF Report."</li>
<li>Review the sort for errors and, if found, send a copy to me via email.</li>
</ol>
<em>I expect some errors, mostly due to oddly shaped call numbers.</em><br>
-    For example: DVD V H S 2 (which is the call number for the 2012 horror film "V/H/S") will always fail to sort correctly until I figure out how to create a rule to process all of the extra spaces.
