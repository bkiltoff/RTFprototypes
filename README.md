RTFprototypes
=============

copies of the rtf prototype (Excel) for staff testing

Navigate to your branch folder and download the Excel file. Any time you need to reset your file (e.g., if you accidentally delete it), you can return to this website to download it again.

I will use this website to push out updates to the file as I complete them, and I will notify you when it is time to download a new copy.
